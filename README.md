## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

> I am Antoine, a hobby Full-Stack Javascript developer. I love designing & integrating UI/UX for personal and community projects. I have completed a Computer Science course at the UniversitÃ© de Paris and I am currently studying to achieve a Software Engineering Degree at EFREI.

> I mainly work with the Vue.js framework/ecosystem for front-end applications and write back-end using Node.js along with TypeScript. I also do infrastructure work in some of my projects. I tend to use tools like Docker for containerisation and orchestration. âš¡
